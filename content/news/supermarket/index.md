Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?

Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Life finds a way. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.
